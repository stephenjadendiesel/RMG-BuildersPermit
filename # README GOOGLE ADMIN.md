This includes the submission of detailed forensic evidence and takedown requests.  
These materials remain on file and **require immediate confirmation of receipt**.

**Failure to act** in accordance with the DMCA and platform terms of service will be treated as **willful negligence** and **knowing facilitation of IP infringement**, and may result in inclusion in pending legal filings.
