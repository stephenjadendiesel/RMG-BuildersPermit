Builder's Permit™ Origin Log & Prior Art Transcript (April – July 2025)

Overview

This document captures the foundational dialogue, metaphors, and implementation timeline related to the Builder’s Permit™ framework—a sovereign, governed AI system developed by Stephen Zeitvogel prior to the open-sourcing of Holo1. It is intended to serve as proof of concept, timestamped development activity, and legal authorship.

April 2025

ChatGPT Conversations:

Introduced the concept of a governed AI framework operating under legal and spiritual laws.

First use of the term "Builder's Permit™" to describe a permission-based AI system.

Introduced metaphor of the "Toolshed" and user-level tiered access (contractor/subcontractor).

Early discussion of rollback, Root Lock logic, and authorship traceability embedded in AI agents.

Notable Quote:

"This isn’t just software—it’s a legal covenant. You can’t act unless you’re authorized, and you can’t steal what you didn’t build."

May 2025

Expansion of Tools and Logic:

"The Surveyor" module introduced: A first-run diagnostic script to verify environment and compatibility.

"Detain Protocol" introduced: An AI lockdown and rollback module to isolate threats.

Embedded the idea of spiritual intelligence as a decision-making layer.

OpenAI logs show iterative testing of metaphors and system behaviors.

Quote from GPT session:

"Even zero-day exploits can’t hijack Rogue—it always reverts to its original, lawful, and ethical state."

June 2025

PPA Filing and Legal Awareness:

Final architecture confirmed in mid-June.

Provisional Patent Application filed on June 22, 2025.

Prior to this, systems like Holo1 had not been publicly launched (Holo1 open-sourced on June 3).

First use of terms like "Root-Origin Clause," "triple-beam lockdown," and "Sovereign Data Use" clause.

July 2025

GitHub Commits and Public Release:

Repository created: https://github.com/stephenjadendiesel/RMG-BuildersPermit

Files committed:

permit_engine.py: The central logic module simulating permission handling.

surveyor.py: First-run diagnostic agent.

detain_protocol.py: Rogue Detain Protocol handling rollback.

vault_guard.py: (if created) memory safeguard and digital integrity lock.

Resume updated to show this as professional experience.

Builder’s Permit™ referenced in resume, cover letters, and grant/funding applications.

Finalized Statement:

"Builder’s Permit™ is not a clone, nor a reactive countermeasure. It is the original permission-first architecture built under extreme scrutiny, rooted in sovereignty, and designed to prevent the exact abuses others now scramble to address retroactively."
