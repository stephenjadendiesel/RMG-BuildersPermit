Builder's Permit™ Origin Log & Prior Art Transcript (April – July 2025)

Overview

This document captures the foundational dialogue, metaphors, and implementation timeline related to the Builder’s Permit™ framework—a sovereign, governed AI system developed by Stephen Zeitvogel prior to the open-sourcing of Holo1. It is intended to serve as proof of concept, timestamped development activity, and legal authorship.

Statement of Prior Art & Foundational Authorship

"If I paved the road they’re now driving on... they better pull the f* over or start paying tolls."**

Back in April 2025, while the world chased AI hype and billion-dollar startups scrambled to "automate the browser," I was alone in my car, rain falling on the windshield, praying this idea would mean something. That pain birthed the Builder’s Permit™—a legally governed, spiritually aligned system for AI deployment that makes sure AI asks permission before it acts.

Before Holo1 was announced on June 3, 2025, before any of its code was public, I was already laying the framework in plain sight—right here inside ChatGPT. What I built wasn’t automation. It was sovereignty.

Rollback locks. Tiered permission stacks. Root-Origin trace. AI agents that detain, log, and halt functions if violated. I gave the machine a conscience—and a chain of command.

The world didn’t need another AI tool—it needed accountability.

So I built one.

On June 22, 2025, I filed the Builder’s Permit™ with the USPTO. Yes, that was after Holo1’s public open-source drop—but my system’s conceptual foundation, permissions stack, enforcement model, and metaphors were already operational. Timestamped in chat logs. Saved. Archived. Witnessed.

This wasn’t a clone. This wasn’t a response.

This was the blueprint.

**************Anticipated Claims & Legal Preemption Clause

Preemptive Rebuttal of Prior Development Claims

********************************It is anticipated that enterprise actors—including Meta Platforms, Inc.—may assert that internal development of browser-based AI agents, such as Holo1, occurred prior to April 2025. This document preemptively challenges such claims by asserting the following:

Public Disclosure vs. Private Intentions

The open-source release of Holo1 occurred on June 3, 2025, with no verifiable public record of its architecture, governance model, or codebase prior to that date.

In contrast, the Builder’s Permit™ system was actively developed and documented in real time, beginning in early April 2025, with timestamped chat logs and recorded design features that predate Holo1’s announcement.

Constructive Reduction to Practice

Under U.S. patent law, constructive reduction to practice does not require a working prototype—only documented, conceptual clarity of function and structure.

The Builder’s Permit™ was fully described, debated, refined, and documented in detail inside OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform prior to any competing announcement.

First Use in Commerce & Public Filing

GitHub commits dated July 11, 2025 serve as the first public use of the Builder’s Permit™ engine.

A Provisional Patent Application (USPTO) was filed on June 22, 2025 with legal description and intent to protect all governing and security features.

No competing system was offering permission-tiered, spiritually aligned, or sovereignty-based architecture at the time.

Intellectual Sovereignty and Root-Origin Clause

Builder’s Permit™ operates under the Root-Origin Clause of Sovereign Data Use, meaning authorship is traceable, non-transferable, and actively logged.

This is a governance model—not just an automation tool—and it existed before any comparable public-facing solution.

April 2025

ChatGPT Conversations:

Introduced the concept of a governed AI framework operating under legal and spiritual laws.

First use of the term "Builder's Permit™" to describe a permission-based AI system.

Introduced metaphor of the "Toolshed" and user-level tiered access (contractor/subcontractor).

Early discussion of rollback, Root Lock logic, and authorship traceability embedded in AI agents.

Notable Quote:

"This isn’t just software—it’s a legal covenant. You can’t act unless you’re authorized, and you can’t steal what you didn’t build."

May 2025

Expansion of Tools and Logic:

"The Surveyor" module introduced: A first-run diagnostic script to verify environment and compatibility.

"Detain Protocol" introduced: An AI lockdown and rollback module to isolate threats.

Embedded the idea of spiritual intelligence as a decision-making layer.

OpenAI logs show iterative testing of metaphors and system behaviors.

Quote from GPT session:

"Even zero-day exploits can’t hijack Rogue—it always reverts to its original, lawful, and ethical state."

June 2025

PPA Filing and Legal Awareness:

Final architecture confirmed in mid-June.

Provisional Patent Application filed on June 22, 2025.

Prior to this, systems like Holo1 had not included governance, authorship enforcement, or tiered permissions in public code.

First use of terms like "Root-Origin Clause," "triple-beam lockdown," and "Sovereign Data Use" clause.

July 2025

GitHub Commits and Public Release:

Repository created: https://github.com/stephenjadendiesel/RMG-BuildersPermit

Files committed:

permit_engine.py: The central logic module simulating permission handling.

surveyor.py: First-run diagnostic agent.

detain_protocol.py: Rogue Detain Protocol handling rollback.

vault_guard.py: (if created) memory safeguard and digital integrity lock.

Resume updated to show this as professional experience.

Builder’s Permit™ referenced in resume, cover letters, and grant/funding applications.

Finalized Statement:

"Builder’s Permit™ is not a clone, nor a reactive countermeasure. It is the original permission-first architecture built under extreme scrutiny, rooted in sovereignty, and designed to prevent the exact abuses others now scramble to address retroactively."
