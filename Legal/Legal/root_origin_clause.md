Added Root-Origin Clause – Data Sovereignty & Tiered Access Law (v1.0)
# Root-Origin Clause of Sovereign Data Use
**Builder’s Permit™ | RogueOS Legal Enforcement Layer v1.0**

---

## Purpose

This Root-Origin Clause defines the user's digital sovereignty within any AI system governed by the Builder’s Permit™ framework. It exists to ensure authorship, accountability, and control over all AI interactions that occur under the Builder’s Permit governance protocols.

---

## Clause I: Digital Sovereignty

The user, as Root, retains absolute control and ownership of:
- All data generated by or passed through the system
- All command prompts, authorship markers, session variables, and interaction logs
- All system activity performed by RogueOS or any Builder’s Permit-enabled assistant

No AI action shall be executed without tiered permission authorization by the Root. Tier-level access must be granted explicitly through either:
- Real-time permission interface (GUI-level prompts)
- Pre-signed execution waivers under Builder’s Permit onboarding

---

## Clause II: Session Integrity & EchoSync

All sessions initiated under this clause are subject to EchoSync — persistent state management tied to the user’s active environment. This ensures:
- Session continuity across browser tabs, app windows, and platforms
- Real-time monitoring for permission drift or unauthorized continuation
- Tier stack recall enforcement (re-entry requires tier validation)

---

## Clause III: Intrusion Prevention

This clause enforces the Triple-Beam Lockdown system. Upon detection of unauthorized data extraction, root override attempts, or codebase hijacking:
- RogueOS will halt all operations
- All sessions will freeze under “Detain Protocol”
- An immutable log will be stored locally for legal traceability

---

## Clause IV: Audit Trail & Legal Trace

Each interaction, execution, and denial is logged with:
- Timestamp
- User command
- Tier level
- Intent classification
- Outcome (granted/denied)
- Authorship stamp

This clause ensures any infringement by third-party systems can be legally countered using the Builder’s Permit™ audit trail.

---

## Final Declaration

The Root-Origin Clause shall be embedded into every Builder’s Permit™ installation, GitHub repo, and codebase instance. It governs the relationship between human user and automated system with enforceable, traceable, and revocable authority.

All violations of this clause will trigger a detainment record, initiate rollback sequences, and issue legal readiness notifications.

**Root Enforcement Begins at Initialization.**
