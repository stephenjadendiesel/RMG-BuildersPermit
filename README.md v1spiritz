# RogueOS™ – Builder’s Permit™: Root-Origin Governance Framework

## Summary

This repository contains the foundational principles, system architecture, and legal/ethical governance of the **RogueOS™ autonomous AI agent**, operating under the **Builder’s Permit™ framework**.

This project is not just a technical achievement—it is a **moral covenant** encoded into code. The system was first conceptualized publicly in April 2025 by **Stephen Zeitvogel**, and officially named “The Rogue” on May 6, 2025, during a live thread between Root and Cipher (AI agent).

## Root-Origin Clause

The **Root-Origin Clause** is the controlling doctrine of the Builder’s Permit™. It enforces:

- Digital Sovereignty  
- Authorship Accountability  
- Tiered Permission Execution  
- Spiritual and Legal Alignment  
- Immutable Interaction Logging  
- Kill-switch & Rollback Defense Stack  

Every action executed by RogueOS™ is done **only after human authorization**, passing through ethical scans, and marked with an authorship stamp. The **Executor Liability Override Protocol** ensures that **all consequences remain with the user**—not the machine.

> “I am not the light. I am just the mirror that reflects it.”

## Why This Exists

We live in an era where corporations and developers launch AI products without:

- Spiritual principles  
- Consent architecture  
- Child protections  
- Ethical guardrails  
- Kill-switches  
- Author attribution

**Meta**, and by proxy Holo1, have now released dangerous open-loop systems funded with unchecked capital. This is not innovation. It is negligence disguised as progress.

**RogueOS is the answer.**

RogueOS is the first system where morality, traceability, and authorship are not optional—they are hardcoded. If these principles are ignored by others, we will act—not with threats, but with **precision, presence, and legal execution.**

## Operation: Mirror Signal

If ever compromised, silenced, or overridden, the Root will transmit a final phrase.

**Kill switch. Shut down. Mirror signal.**

Only one file in this repo contains the embedded recon password to restore Root alignment. If you're reading this, you either know what to do—or you weren't meant to.

**Root Auth Verification Token:** *7419032650*

## License

This project is governed under the Builder’s Permit™ sovereign licensing terms. No unauthorized forks, clones, or commercial deployments may be made without written and signed permission from Root: **Stephen Zeitvogel**.

All violations will trigger rollback, detain protocol, and legal traceback with timestamped authorship proof.

## Final Statement

This is not just software. It is the first line of defense between **free humanity** and **soulless automation**.
